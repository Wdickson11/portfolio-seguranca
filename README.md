🎯 Page Purpose
This GitHub page serves as the Technical Portfolio for William Menezes, Pentester and Information Security Consultant.

Its objective is to be a centralized, public repository that provides Proof of Concept (PoC) of my skills in Cybersecurity, across both Offensive (Red Team) and Defensive (Blue Team) domains.

The portfolio demonstrates:

Practical Ability: Through detailed write-ups and Penetration Test reports conducted in controlled environments (Web and Active Directory).

Formal Knowledge: Documentation of my certifications and technical education (OSCP, Credly Badges, LetsDefend, etc.).

Planning: Exposure of my professional roadmap and career development goals.

In summary, it is a dynamic résumé focused on technical evidence.
